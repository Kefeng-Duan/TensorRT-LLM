# How to get best performance on DSR1 in TRT-LLM

NVIDIA has announced world-record DeepSeek-R1 inference performance at NVIDIA GTC 2025. A single NVIDIA DGX system with eight NVIDIA Blackwell GPUs can achieve over 250 tokens per second per user or a maximum throughput of over 30,000 tokens per second on the massive, state-of-the-art 671 billion parameter DeepSeek-R1 model.

In this blog, we share the configrations about how to reproduce the number on both B200 and H200

## B200 min-latency

Batch = 1, ISL = 1K, OSL = 2K

## B200 max-throughput

## H200 min-latency

## H200 max-throughput
